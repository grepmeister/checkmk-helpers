= Some simple REST API curl scripts

* Ansible is still to overhelming for me, therefore I still use simple curl REST API calls and filter them with jq.
* I extend my $PATH to point to the script folder so I can use it on my local sites and in vagrant boxes.
* This is still WIP.

== idea 

They have to be run as site user because:

* they grab the secret from ~/var/check_mk/web/automation/automation.secret
* they grab the apache port, site name from ~/etc/omd/site.conf

== scripts

== rest-api-activate-changes.sh

* activate changes of current site

== rest-api-create-folder.sh

* create a folder <site> in main folder of <site> with no-ip and no-piggyback
* used for licensing testing

== rest-api-get-all-folder.sh

* show all folders with two possible options: path and recursive

== rest-api-get-all-hosts.sh

* show simple list of hosts of site, faster than cmk --list-hosts
* plain text output instead of json
